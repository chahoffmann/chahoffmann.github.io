I'm a cryptographer working as a postdoc in Krzysztof Pietrzak's group at ISTA. My research interests are time-released cryptography, provable security, post-quantum security, idealized models and secret sharing.

My [Erdős-Bacon number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number) is 7.
